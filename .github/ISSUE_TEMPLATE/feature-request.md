# **IMPORTANT**
please don't submit any of these requests until release 0.5.0-dev. at that point I'll have an ok-ish base and will be ready to expand upon it. I'm also not going to accept any outside help until that version. I may never get to 0.5.0-dev.

**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
I need to know that if your feature is an addition or a fix which isn't quite directly on the bug spectrum. It's perfectly valid if it's either

**What's your request?**
A very short introduction proposing your feature/fix

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A description of what you want to happen

**Why?**
I know this question can be hard but that's the point, if I'm to add a feature/fix thought of by someone else then I need to have a really strong understanding of what the purpose of your feature is
